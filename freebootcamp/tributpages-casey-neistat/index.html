                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li><time>1981-03-25</time> Casey was born</li>
                        <li>He dropped out of Ledyard High School in the 10th grade at age 15 and did not return to school or graduate.</li>
                        <li>Prior to moving to New York City, Neistat worked as a dishwasher at a restaurant[14] and short order cook in Mystic, Connecticut. His first job in New York City was as a
                            bike
                            messenger.</li>
                        <li>In mid-2001 Neistat and his brother Van began working with the artist Tom Sachs, ultimately making a series of films about the artist's sculptures and installations. This
                            was
                            the earliest work done by the brothers as a collective.</li>
                        <li>His first viral video: <b><i>iPod's Dirty Secret</i></b> from 2013 was watched by 957 860 people (September 2016)</li>
                        <li>The most popular movie on his You Tube chanell - <b><i>Make It Count</i></b> - was watched by over 20 239 031 people!</li>
                        <li>As of September 11, 2016, Neistat has released 924 vlogs and short films on his YouTube channel since its creation on February 15, 2010. The subject matter of the films
                            varies
                            greatly and most feature Neistat. On August 22, 2015, Neistat reached 1 million subscribers which increased to 4 million by August 2016</li>
                        <li>Neistat started to post daily vlogs on YouTube on March 24, 2015. On his May 15, 2015, vlog post "The Vice President, Outer Space and the Baby," Neistat stated that he sees
                            his
                            vlogs more as a forum as opposed to a daily journal. On January 19, 2016 Neistat posted his 300th vlog. As a result of vlogging everyday, Neistat said he has chosen to
                            refrain
                            from making any feature length content. Neistat is frequently seen using and discussing his collection of Boosted boards in his daily vlogs, which are sometimes showcased
                            in
                            his other YouTube videos</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 align="center"><b>Beme</b></h2>
                    <p align="justify"> In a July 8, 2015 vlog, Neistat announced that he has been working with Matt Hackett on building a video sharing app called Beme. Designed as an alternative to
                        highly edited content found in social media, the app enables users to produce unedited four-second videos, which are immediately uploaded and shared with the user's
                        subscribers,
                        without the ability to review the video. Users respond to shared content by sending "reactions", photographs of themselves, back to the video uploader.
                        <br>
                        <br>Beme released the first version of the app on <time>July 17, 2015.</time> Shortly after the launch, BuzzFeed described Beme's minimalist design as "deceptively simple and
                        decidedly weird." The New York Times explained that Beme's user experience is "as if the phone becomes a stand-in for one's body, the camera facing outward to capture what the
                        user
                        is experiencing." Within eight days of the app's release, Beme users had shared 1.1 million videos and logged 2.4 million reactions.
